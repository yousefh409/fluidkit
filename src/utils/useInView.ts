/**
 * Off-screen pause detection.
 *
 * Looping primitives (Droplets, Thinking) should stop animating while
 * their element is scrolled out of view, to save CPU/GPU. This hook is the
 * shared mechanism: it watches a DOM node with IntersectionObserver and
 * reports whether it's currently intersecting the viewport.
 *
 * Default when IntersectionObserver is unavailable (SSR, old browsers) is
 * `true` (in view). We can't observe visibility there, and defaulting to
 * `false` would permanently freeze the animation — `true` is the safe
 * choice: worst case we animate when we didn't strictly need to, rather
 * than never animating at all.
