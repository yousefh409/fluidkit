/**
 * Material-style water ripple: expands from the pointer's tap/click position
 * and fades out, clipped to the surface's box (and its border-radius).
 *
 * Structure: a `position:relative; overflow:hidden` wrapper carries the
 * consumer's children plus an absolutely-positioned, `pointer-events:none`
 * overlay that draws each active ripple as a `motion.span`. `overflow:hidden`
 * on the wrapper is what clips ripples to the surface — including rounded
 * corners, since the overlay's `borderRadius` is set to `inherit`.
 * `pointer-events:none` on the overlay keeps the children (buttons, links,
 * ...) fully interactive underneath it.
 *
 * Ripple spawning/removal is delegated entirely to `useRipple`: pointer down
 * pushes a ripple, and each ripple removes itself via `onAnimationComplete`
 * once its exit animation finishes (no timers to get out of sync with
 * Motion's actual animation duration).
 *
 * Under `prefers-reduced-motion`, `useRipple`'s `onPointerDown` no-ops, so no
 * ripple ever spawns and the wrapper just renders children normally.
