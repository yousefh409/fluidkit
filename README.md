# fluidkit

[![CI](https://github.com/yousefh409/fluidkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yousefh409/fluidkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A React library of liquid UI animations built on one idea: **one liquid engine, swappable materials.** Shapes are real metaball geometry (computed bezier bridges applied as a live `clip-path`), motion is spring-driven with surface tension (drops connect on touch, stretch, and snap), and the same shape renders as clear glass or a flat fill via a `material` prop. Built on top of [Motion](https://motion.dev).

## The core principle

**Animate the surface, never the text.** Every morph separates a surface layer (the liquid shape, free to scale, stretch, or merge) from a content layer (text / controls, which only cross-fades, never scales). Text always stays crisp.

## Install

```bash
npm install fluidkit react react-dom motion
```

`react`, `react-dom`, and `motion` are peer dependencies (bring your own shared copy).

### Optional GPU tier

`LiquidMetal` is a real WebGL primitive. It lives behind its own subpath export (`fluidkit/liquid-metal`), not the core `fluidkit` entry, so the core bundle stays GPU-free whether or not you use it. Its GPU library is an optional peer dependency: installing fluidkit without it never warns, and importing the core entry never resolves it.

```bash
npm i @paper-design/shaders-react@0.0.76   # for fluidkit/liquid-metal (pinned exact)
```

```tsx
import { LiquidMetal } from "fluidkit/liquid-metal";
```

See [`docs/primitives/liquid-metal.md`](docs/primitives/liquid-metal.md) for props, fallback behavior, and caveats.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { MorphSurface, Thinking } from "fluidkit";

function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);
  return (
    <div onClick={() => setOpen((v) => !v)}>
      <MorphSurface
        open={open}
        closedContent={<span>Ask fluidkit</span>}
        openContent={open && <ChatPanel />}
      />
      {loading && <Thinking />}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Primitives (v0.3)

| Primitive | What it does | Degrades to |
|---|---|---|
| [`MorphSurface`](docs/primitives/morph-surface.md) | One liquid body: pill morphs into panel, satellite droplets absorbed through real bridges | Instant snap + opacity-only face fade |
| [`Droplets`](docs/primitives/droplets.md) | Drop cluster with surface tension; grab / drag / tear / re-merge with the pointer (`interactive`) | Separate static dots |
| [`Thinking`](docs/primitives/thinking.md) | Working indicator: droplets merge and split (`role="status"`) | Three static dots |
| [`FlowStagger`](docs/primitives/flow-stagger.md) | Staggered rise + un-blur entrance for list items, FLIP on reorder | Simple simultaneous fade |
| [`LiquidTabs`](docs/primitives/liquid-tabs.md) | Flagship tab strip: the indicator flows between tabs (slide or stretch), ink or glass material, labels tint by liquid coverage | Plain pill, snaps instantly |
| [`Ripple`](docs/primitives/ripple.md) | Pointer-origin water ripple on tap/click | No ripple, children render normally |
| [`JellyButton`](docs/primitives/jelly-button.md) | Engine pill button that squashes on press via geometry; the label never scales | Normal button with an opacity press dip |
| [`MeshGradient`](docs/primitives/mesh-gradient.md) | Ambient CSS backdrop: large blurred radial-gradient blobs drift slowly behind your content | Static blobs at their home position |
| [`Silk`](docs/primitives/silk.md) | Ambient CSS backdrop: full-height diagonal gradient sheets flowing like slow fabric | Static sheets at their home position |
| [`GlassPanes`](docs/primitives/glass-panes.md) | Glass-native backdrop: edge-to-edge frosted panes sliding on a shared diagonal, each at its own blur depth | Layered frosted fills |
| [`LiquidSwitch`](docs/primitives/liquid-switch.md) | Toggle: the thumb droplet tears off one well through a real bridge and merges into the other; real hidden checkbox underneath | Thumb snaps; the on-tint still flips |
| [`LiquidCheckbox`](docs/primitives/liquid-checkbox.md) | The check is liquid: a droplet lands and fills the well; `indeterminate` is a half-filled meniscus | Fill level snaps |
| [`LiquidSlider`](docs/primitives/liquid-slider.md) | Droplet thumb riding the meniscus edge of a part-filled channel; real hidden range input underneath | Thumb tracks the value, no spring lag |
| [`LiquidField`](docs/primitives/liquid-field.md) | Text field on a glass surface: the input stays real and crisp, focus swells the surface + shows the focus meniscus | Swell dropped; focus ring stays |
| [`LiquidProgress`](docs/primitives/liquid-progress.md) | Determinate progress as a vessel filling; the meniscus wobbles only while the value moves | Fill width tracks the value |
| [`LiquidToast`](docs/primitives/liquid-toast.md) | `toast()` notifications that condense at the screen corner and evaporate on dismiss | Opacity-only in/out |
| [`LiquidMenu`](docs/primitives/liquid-menu.md) | Dropdown that pours from its trigger; full ARIA menu keyboard pattern | Opacity fade over poured geometry |
| [`LiquidBadge`](docs/primitives/liquid-badge.md) | Notification count that absorbs increments through a metaball bridge; the number only cross-fades | Count cross-fades |
| [`LiquidMetal`](docs/primitives/liquid-metal.md) | Optional GPU tier: a real WebGL liquid-metal shader (`fluidkit/liquid-metal`) | Static metallic-gradient fallback |

### Materials

Every surface component shares one styling pack, applied wherever it's physically meaningful: `material` (`"glass"`/`"flat"`), `tint`/`color` (the glass tint or flat fill), `intensity` (how loudly the material reads, `0`-`1` or `"whisper"`/`"present"`), `light` (scene light position; `null` disables speculars), `reflection` (specular highlights on/off), `refraction` (opt-in Chromium-only edge lensing), and `shadow` (drop shadow on/off). Components omit only what can't physically apply: `LiquidText`'s lighting is its sheen sweep, not the scene light, so it takes none of `light`/`reflection`/`refraction`/`shadow`.

- `glass` — white tint + backdrop blur/saturation, specular highlights from one configurable scene light (`light` prop), toggleable via `reflection`. Opt-in `refraction` adds Chromium-only edge lensing (SVG displacement inside `backdrop-filter`; degrades silently). A drop of water is liquid glass.
- `flat` — plain color; also the automatic fallback when `backdrop-filter` is unsupported.

## Cross-cutting guarantees

- **Reduced motion**: `prefers-reduced-motion` collapses every effect to a clean static state; animation loops never run.
- **SSR-safe**: nothing touches `window` at import time or during render.
- **Tree-shakeable**: named exports from a single entry point (`sideEffects: false`).
- **Theming**: colors, tint, light position, and physics via props. No brand shipped.
- **Graceful degradation**: feature detection picks the best available path; never hard-fails.
- **Performance**: animation loops pause off-screen (IntersectionObserver) and under reduced motion.

## Roadmap

- **v0.2**: the liquid engine + `Droplets`, `Thinking`, `MorphSurface` in glass/mercury/flat.
- **v0.3 (this release)**: `LiquidTabs` on the engine, grab/tear/re-merge pointer interactions, opt-in refraction, per-frame DOM writes (no React commits in animation loops), docs site.
- **v1.0**: stable API, a11y pass, npm publish.

## Docs site

The playground doubles as the public docs site: hero, live demos, controls, and copy-paste snippets for every primitive.

- Develop: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build:site` → static bundle in `dist-site/`, deployable to any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel — no server needed).

## More

- Design spec: [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-liquid-engine-design.md`](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-liquid-engine-design.md)
- Changelog: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)

## Development

- `npm test`: run tests
- `npm run typecheck`: type check the library
- `npm run size`: check bundle size (14.9 kB brotli budget on the core entry via size-limit)
- `npm run check:gpu-leak`: guard against GPU dependencies
- `npm run check:pack`: verify npm pack contents

All guards run in CI (Node 20 and 24).
